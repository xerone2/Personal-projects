**Console-Based Password Manager**

**Overview**
Welcome to the Console-Based Password Manager ‚Äì a secure and simple solution for managing your passwords and other credentials. This Python-based password manager employs robust cryptographic algorithms, including Argon2 for key derivation, Base64 for encoding, and cryptography Fernet for encryption, ensuring the utmost security for your sensitive information.

**Features**

Secure Storage: Utilizes Argon2 for secure key derivation, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to crack passwords.
Data Encryption: Implements cryptography Fernet for encrypting and decrypting credentials, adding an extra layer of protection to your stored data.

User-Friendly Interface: A console-based interface that is easy to navigate, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.
